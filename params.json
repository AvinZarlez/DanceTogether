No hand gestures. No commmincation *of any kind*, except for Dance.\r\n\r\nFind your dance partner.\r\n\r\n### Requirements: ###\r\n\r\n- 4 to 9 players (even numbers recommended)\r\n- A \"dance floor\" large enough for everyone to dance simutaniously \r\n- Each player has their own device **with headphones**.\r\n\r\n### How to set up the game: ###\r\n\r\nHave each player make sure their devices are all on *the same* WiFi network.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Peer to peer commications have to be enabled on the network. This may not work on some public WiFi network.\r\n\r\nStart the game and choose \"Find Other Players\"\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The game is currently bugged/broken for players joining and/or leaving games mid-game. This will be fixed in future versions\r\n\r\nIn theory, the game should automatically detect and join a game.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** If you have issues getting a player connect, have all players \"Disconnnect\" and start over.\r\n\r\nOnce you are in the game, your game background will change to match your player color.\r\n\r\nAt the top, you can enter up to 3 characters to idenifty yourself to the other players. In the middle, you can see who else is currently in the game. At the bottom, \"Ready\" and \"Back\" buttons.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready, click the \"Ready\" button on your screen. Once every player has marked themselves as \"Ready\", the game will begin.\r\n\r\n### How to play: ###\r\n\r\nOnce you hear music, start dancing!\r\n\r\nWatch the other players closely, and decide which player is listening to the same song as you.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Remember to show the other players your screen so they can see your color/idenity characters!\r\n\r\nOnce you've decided, tap the player you think is right. Don't stop dancing yet! Other players need to decide if they're a match to you.\r\n\r\nWhen every player has chosen, or 60 seconds has passed, the music will stop and you may stop dancing.\r\n\r\nScores are given, and after 15 seconds the next round will automatically start.\r\n\r\nAfter three rounds, the final scores are given and a winner is declared.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to play again, hit the \"Play Again\" button. Once every player has hit the \"Play Again\" button, a new game will begin.\r\n\r\n### Scoring: ###\r\n\r\nIf you are the first player to lock in a choice, you get an additional 100 points.\r\n\r\nFor every second left on the clock when you locked in your choice, you get an additional 10 points.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the round, if your dance partner guessed correctly you will get 500 points and they will get 250.\r\n\r\nThat means if both you and your dance partner guessed correctly you will both earn a total of 750 points. However, if only one of you guesses correctly, the correct guesser will get 250 points and their partner 500. For maximum points, make sure your dance partner knows you're the correct choice! \r\n\r\n### What was the inspiration behind the game? ###\r\n\r\nTobiah got the idea to create this game at a friend's wedding. At the wedding, they had a \"Silent Disco\", where a DJ played music directly into a series of wireless headphones. Tobiah noticed that anybody who didn't like the current song put the headphones down stopped dancing. He thought to himself: \"Wouldn't it have been great if we had two of these going at once, so everybody could dance together?\"\r\n\r\nImmidately, the idea for the game was born.\r\n\r\n## Open Source: ##\r\n\r\nAll of the code and Unity project files are licenced under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\nCertain music assets may contain different licences, see credits for details.\r\n\r\n### Why make the game open source? ###\r\n\r\nThis project is about making a fun game for people to play together, not about generating revenue.\r\n\r\nOpen sourcing the game has some distinked advantages:\r\n\r\n- Free for all: Players can install the game on as many devices as they want, with no in app purchases or ads.\r\n- Community Built: Game developers from all over the world can contribute features and bug fixes to the game.\r\n- Learning Resource: Making your own local network based Unity game? Use this as an example! Learn from a real world working project.\r\n\r\nThat said, Tobiah Zarlez has released official verions of the game on the following platforms:\r\n\r\n- None yet. Coming soon.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you only use and share official builds of the game with your family and friends.\r\n\r\n### Can I contribute? ###\r\n\r\nYes!
